        <h2 class="top">Age is Just a Number</h2>
        <section class="LBJ_History">
          <p>
            Age is just a number for the great LeBron James.
            At 37 years old, LeBron is playing some of the best basketball of his career. 
            By numbers alone, he’d be an easy candidate to win the NBA MVP award. Yet due to 
            the season-long struggles of the 18-19 Los Angeles Lakers, 
            James is being overlooked as a bonafide candidate.
            However, even if the Lakers fail to turn things around, there’s a strong case to be 
            made for the King still winning his fifth MVP. 
            And he wouldn’t be the first player to win the award despite playing on a losing club.
            The first half of James’ fourth season in LA didn’t go as planned. Ankle and abdomen 
            injuries cost him 10 total games, while a brief stint in health and safety protocols 
            and a suspension cost him an additional one game each. But from the start of December 
            onward, the future Hall of Famer has been playing at a whole new level.
            In 14 December contests, James averaged 30.7 points on 55.5% shooting from the field and 
            40.4% from three. He ended the month scoring 30 or more points in seven straight games, 
            his longest such streak since 2013. The last of which came during a 139-106 win over the 
            Portland Trail Blazers, where the new 37-year-old finished with 43 points, 14 rebounds, 
            two steals, two blocks, and zero turnovers. Thanks to an amazing month, LeBron now owns 
            season averages of 28.6 points (which would place him second in the NBA behind Kevin Durant 
            if he had enough games to qualify), 7.5 rebounds, 6.6 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.1 blocks. 
            Out of those five stats, only assists don’t exceed his career averages.

          <h2 class="top">Ranking The King's Top 5 Dunks of All Time</h2>
          <section class="LBJ_History">
          <p>
            A dunk is worth just two points, but the best dunkers in the world
            always find ways to make it feel like more. From signature in-game
            slams to unforgettable posterizations to you-had-to-be-there dunk
            contest moments, players from generations past and present have left
            an indelible mark on the game with their ability to finish at the
            rim. At 37-years-old and in his 19th season in the NBA, LeBron James
            continues to dazzle the league. More than just his skills, the
            four-time MVP is still showing almost the same kind of athleticism
            that was his hallmark upon entering the league straight out of high
            school. The King apparently still has the hops.

            In a story posted on his Instagram account, LeBron James features
            images of his high-leaping plays at different points in his career.
            Year 19, 18, 17, 13 and 9 all show King James skying above the rim
            for rim-rattling dunks. When given the chance, he still resembles
            the overpowering L-Train moniker of his younger days. The four-time
            champion going downhill is still one of the most fearsome forces in
            the NBA. There’s almost no stopping him with his combination of
            power, guile and skill when going to the rack. In addition to his
            Sportscenter-worthy dunks, LeBron James is just as flashy with his
            blocks. His trademark chase-down dunks regularly make the headlines.
            Perhaps no other player gets recognized for blocks more than King
            James. The soon-to-be 18x All-Star has also moved into 7th in the
            all-time assists ladder. He is the only player to get into the top
            10 in scoring, assists and steals. No player is even in the top 30.

            >? LeBron James has had one of, if not the greatest career in NBA history. 
            Unlike so many legendary figures in the past, who began to decline as they 
            grew older, James has played at a consistently elite level throughout his entire 
            career. And even in year 19, James is one of the best players in the league with 
            the way he is playing.There's no doubt about it. LeBron James is one of the, if 
            not the best, dunk artist in the game today. One of James' biggest weapons in his 
            arsenal is his athleticism. At 6'8, James is one of the most athletic players in 
            NBA history. The way he moves with the ball at his size, and his ability to finish 
            at the rim is almost unparalleled. And that athleticism has barely declined as he 
            has grown older. Not only does he catch alley-oops like it's a walk in the park, 
            he also throws down dunks with an incredible ferocity and power that some have 
            defined byhaving "no regard for human life." We can take a look back at the
            greatest dunks of his NBA career has been able to accomplish these
            past 18 years. LeBron is the definition of a high-flyer, and at
            6'8'' 265 pounds, there aren't many players that can stop him, and
            believe me, you'll see quite a few guys in the who thought they
            could:

            As Kevin Harlan put it perfectly: “LeBron James with no regard for human life!” This is definitely one of
            the most memorable dunks LeBron James has ever thrown down. Defensive Player of the Year Kevin
            Garnett was just a tad bit late, and it ended up being the perfect Kodak moment:<br>

            No words needed. The poster, the stare down, the atmosphere. The King literally shocked TD Garden
            and the media on this eventful night. Although he received a technical foul quickly after the play, it was
            warranted due to the fact that the dunk was just plain mean. James even expressed later on that the
            dunk was much sweeter because Jason Terry talked so much.<br>

            Tim Duncan was a little bit too fundamental on this one.  He probably could have got the charge call if he had 
            actually flopped. The most ridiculous part of this dunk isn't the fact that LeBron nearly cleared the 6'11'' 
            center, it's that he took off from right around the dotted line from inside the paint. This dunk is absolutely 
            insane on a lot of levels, but most of all because again LeBron makes it look way too easy. I bet Tim Duncan 
            learns something from his buddy Tony Parker and just moves out of the way next time.<br>

            LeBron's epic dunk over John Lucas almost made it to the number one spot, but it fell just short. John Lucas 
            stands at 5'11'', which by NBA standards is pretty short.  But when you watch the dunk and realize that LeBron 
            cleanly cleared him without really trying, you understand just how impressive jumping over a human being really 
            is. Not only did he jump over a decent-sized man, but he also got the alley-oop with one hand and threw it down 
            with quite a bit of force.  If you're a hater of this dunk, you're not allowed to comment until you've caught an 
            alley-oop while jumping over someone 5'11''.<br>

            This one just hits all the feels. It’s crazy to think about the timing, the execution, and the sentimental value 
            that this dunk brought upon all Lakers fans. Everyone remembers how it was eerily similar to one that Kobe Bryant 
            pulled off 19 years ago, with the same reverse windmill in the third quarter on a fast break. Therefore, this dunk 
            will probably go down as the most iconic one James has ever thrown down in a Lakers uniform:<br>
